# Hey ðŸ‘‹

### You made it here, you are curious

This is a simple SvelteKit site hosted on vercel. Pretty much all the code is in the main route file `/src/routes/index.svelte`

The only thing missing is the url i'm parsing which is in an .env file:
`VITE_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ItzLevvie/MicrosoftTeams-msinternal/master/defconfig`

If you have a question or find a bug open an issue
